The purpose of the assignment was to replicate the 'homework assignment.gif' website along with the functionality.

I built the navigator bar in the header element. i used nav/li to list nav contents. i used flexbox to create distance 
between the logo and nav content. I used the id for 'about me', 'work', 'contact me' to create a link

I created a section for the 'hero image' and 'about me' content. I used flexbox to separate the sidebar from main content.

In the main section, i created the five boxes using flexbox. I used a hover pseudo element to create the animation upon hover.

I placed contents of the footer in the footer element and used flexbox to separate it from the sidebar.
